          <br/>
          I'm Santiago, a Langara College student.
          <br/>
          During my college years I gained the skills needed to design, develop, deploy and maintain
          Software, ranging from beautiful front-end websites, to full-stack applications, working with 
          several moving parts {"(microservices, API's)"}.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I love the puzzle that software development offers. Not only this,
          but I'm also excited to expand my knowledge by working with like-minded people
          with more experience.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          On a personal level I'd say I'm a someone who is very interested in the world.
          what it has to offer, and how other people perceive it. I enjoy
            philosophy, learning languages, and being outdoors.
